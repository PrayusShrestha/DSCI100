# Data Science 100 Term Project
Final project for DSCI 100: Introduction to Data Science. My team and I created a classification model using R and the KNN algorithm to identify "All-Star" NBA players 
based on their individual statistics. Our final submission is in [report.ipynb](https://github.com/PrayusShrestha/DSCI100/blob/main/report.ipynb).
